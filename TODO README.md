Quick todo:

1) Troubleshooting: if I
I] create a new type of exercise, and then
II] go to the sessions page, and either add a new session with newType, or edit an existing session to have newType
III] go to the exerciseType page, and delete this newType
IV] attempt to go to the sessions page
I receive the following message:

This is bad and I don't want it to stay this way.




2) I want to try investigating to see if all exercise sessions created by one user are accessible/editable by everyone else (they shouldn't be. There should be some baseline exercises that everyone gets, then everyone has their own data for the schema)


3) when I edit a session, it goes to the bottom of the page. How do I stop this? I want entries displayed organized by their date, I think


Goals:

-maybe we should add a set limit to how many entries show up on a page...?

-clean up UI
--add prettier error handling
--add more links

-implement 'set goal' function
--future: maybe implement machine learning?
