short-term goals:

weight_set should show the exercise type!!

lol why are we showing user

sort by weight!! (on weight_set page)
sort by weight!! (on general page) or other params
everything that could realistically be desired as 'sortable' should be sortable

Make a lot of these things hyperlinks
show weight_sets on exercise_session page

weights in kg OR lb (weights should accept decimal numbers)

(maybe hide the excess info on date from the user)

reps maybe should use dropdown!

on 'create' (multiple pages), make sure the 'create' shows useful information (not in terms of the object's mem number thing)

VARIANT INPUT
create from the weight_set!

'exercise program' is really not an intuitive term


medium-term goals:

-maybe we should add a set limit to how many entries show up on a page...?

-add 'compound view'

-add an 'import csv' option for users
-add an 'export csv' option for users

-clean up UI
--add prettier error handling
--add more links

long-term goals:

-implement 'strength per pound' tracker

-implement 'set goal' function
--future: maybe implement machine learning?
