short-term goals:

-add 'compound view'


Pages shouldn't start being numbered at 0 :)


-anchors



sort by weight!! (on weight_set page)
sort by weight!! (on general page) or other params
everything that could realistically be desired as 'sortable' should be sortable

weights in kg OR lb (weights should accept decimal numbers)

reps maybe should use dropdown!

show weight_sets on exercise_session page

VARIANT INPUT
create from the weight_set!

'exercise program' is really not an intuitive term

-google 'pagination ruby on rails activerecord'
--pagination gem
--start at




-add an 'import csv' option for users
-add an 'export csv' option for users

-clean up UI
--add prettier error handling
