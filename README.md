What the heck this project is: 

It's a biometric webapp! 
Users can log in, and enter metrics such as 
  calories consumed in a day, 
  weight measured in a given day, 
  exercise performance in a given exercise session 

Then back-end logic can track this information and provide estimates of what might happen if the user wanted to: 
 gain/lose X pounds in Y days, while maintaining Z exercise-performance during that time! (this is where the data science stuff comes in)
